Do not use Angular CLI directly (Unless that env are already created), because the envs are created with the .env

## Steps:

1. Clone the .env.template and rename it with .env
2. Fill the envs
3. Create Angular Envs (optional)

```
npm run envs
```

4. For development, execute:

```
npm run start
```

5. For production, execute:

```
npm run build
```
